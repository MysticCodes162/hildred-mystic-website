  <h2>1. The Birth of Artificial Intelligence (1962)</h2>
  <p>
    AI began its journey in 1962 when researchers first attempted to create machines
    capable of thinking like humans. These systems were simple — solving checkers
    or math problems — but they marked the beginning of a revolution.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How Gaming Shaped AI</h2>

  <p>
    Early video games like <em>Tennis for Two</em>, <em>Pac-Man</em>, and
    <em>Donkey Kong</em> forced developers to build smarter algorithms.
    Pathfinding, decision-making, and learning systems were born here.
  </p>

  <h2>3. The Rise of Arcades & Home Consoles</h2>
  <p>
    The 80s and 90s pushed AI forward through simple yet challenging games that
    required fast adaptation and pattern recognition.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Early 2000s: Online Gaming + Branding Tech</h2>
  <p>
    With the internet came MMOs like <em>World of Warcraft</em>. AI now had to
    control thousands of NPCs at once. Meanwhile, businesses used AI for ads,
    customer behavior data, and marketing.
  </p>

  <h2>5. The Internet Explosion</h2>
  <p>
    Search engines, social media, and e-commerce accelerated AI more than anything
    before. Massive datasets pushed machine learning into every industry.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Tesla & the Mobile Revolution</h2>

  <p>
    In 2014, Tesla changed everything with self-driving technology. Mobile phones
    advanced AI further with Siri, Google Assistant, facial recognition, and real-time
    translation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>The journey isn’t over — we’re only at the beginning.</strong></p>
